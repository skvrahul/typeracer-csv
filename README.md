# Typeracer CSV

Typeracer requires you to have a paid account for you to export your data into a CSV format. 
This is a (hacky) workaround for that to export your race data into a CSV format by scraping data off the history page and storing into a CSV file.

## Requirements
 - pandas
 - selenium(with a webdrivers executable in your PATH)
